Fetures:
1) Creates and saves song playlists
2) Every playlist supports adding unlimited songs
3) Search on "iTunes" in built-in search feature to add any song you want to in the playlist. It has pagination as well to continuously load songs from "iTunes" with the searched keyword.
4) Two types of layouts of the saved playlist listing. One is list and other one is sections
5) Purly built on SwiftUI and using CoreData as persistence container

NOTE: 
The app works and looks best in DARK MODE on apple devices. Light mode also works but the main design looks best on dark mode.
This is just a time pass project and the structure is not very good but the app works.
